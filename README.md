# Food-Recipe-Optimizer
The Food Recipe Optimizer lets users input a recipe link to fetch ingredients and instructions, analyze nutrition (fat, carbs, protein, fiber), and adapt recipes for dietary needs like vegan or healthy while showing original vs. modified ingredients. Logged-in users can save recipes as favorites and view a nutrition pie chart of all saved recipes.
